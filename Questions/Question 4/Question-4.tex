\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Introduction
\label{Introduction}}{Introduction }}\label{introduction}}

This question will provide insight into industry fund flows between
actively managed funds. More specifically, I will firstly be evaluating
whether funds that have performed well in the past provides an indicator
to investors that they will perform well in the future. I will then be
evaluating whether this is a good investment strategy, to continually
invest in funds that have performed well in the past. A crucial
component of this analysis is the look back period, ie) how long must a
fund perform well before it is indacted as an above average performing
fund. In this question I will be evaluating a look back period of 3
years and 10 years.

\hypertarget{loading-the-data-and-relevant-packages}{%
\subsection{Loading the data and relevant
packages}\label{loading-the-data-and-relevant-packages}}

The relevant data that is loaded here contains information on the
various actively traded funds, along with trading flow data and returns.

\hypertarget{data-preperation}{%
\subsection{Data preperation}\label{data-preperation}}

To prepare this data for analysis I join the two flows and returns data
sets, insure that the date is of the correct format and filter out any
``Fund of Funds'' data.

\hypertarget{defining-the-look-back-period-and-future-performance-periods}{%
\subsection{Defining the look-back period and future performance
periods}\label{defining-the-look-back-period-and-future-performance-periods}}

For the first comparison I will be evaluating a look back period of
three years. This look back period is the shortest of the look back
periods that will be evaluated. The main takeaway from this analysis is
as follows; if a fund performs well for a fairly short period of three
years, does this indicate that the future is bright for the fund and
will this attract new investment?

\subsection{Calculating cumulative returns for the 3 year look back
period}\label{calculating-cumulative-returns-for-the-3-year-look-back-period}}

The cumulative returns of the 3 year period is calculated so that a
comparative analysis can be done.

\hypertarget{analyizing-fund-flows-and-future-performance}{%
\subsection{Analyizing fund flows and future
performance}\label{analyizing-fund-flows-and-future-performance}}

Calculating the future performance (the performance a year after the
look back period) will provide somewhat of an answer to whether the look
back period was a good indicating of the following period.

\hypertarget{analyizing-data}{%
\subsection{Analyizing data}\label{analyizing-data}}

To analyze the data, a scatter plot, correlation analysis and regression
analysis will be conducted.

\hypertarget{scatter-plot-illustrating-the-relationship-between-past-performance-and-future-performance}{%
\subsubsection{Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between past
performance and future
performance}\label{scatter-plot-illustrating-the-relationship-between-past-performance-and-future-performance}}

{\centering \includegraphics{Question-4_files/figure-latex/Figure 1-1} 

}

\caption{3 year look back scatter plot \label{Figure1}}\label{fig:Figure 1}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from the above graph, there does seem to be a positive
correlation between past cumulative returns and future performance.
However, not so straight forward, as there are some funds that had a
poor past cumulative return but had good future returns. Lets do some
further analysis.

\hypertarget{correlation-analysis-between-cumulative-past-returns-3-years-and-total-flow}{%
\subsubsection{correlation analysis between cumulative past returns (3
years) and total

\end{longtable}

The above correlation analysis provides some interesting results. The
output suggests that there is a weak positive relationship between funds
past 3 years performance and fund flows. Thus, although three years past
performance may induce some flows towards that fund this pull is not
relatively strong. Since the p-value is below 0.05 this weak postie
relationship is not random. Therefore, although there is some truth in
saying a 3 year strong performing fund will induce more investment.
there are most probably a lot more factors that goes into the selection
process of investors when deciding where to allocate there funds.

This regression analysis shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship between past return values and future return values. Thus
funds with higher past returns tend to have higher future returns.
However the R-squared value is fairly low at 0.12 which suggests that
past performance only explain 12\% of the variation in future
performance. Thus although past performance does have a statistically
significant positive relationship with future performance, this
relationship is fairly week and should not be solely relied upon.

As can be seen from the above figure, there is a far greater variability
when the look back period is increased to 10 years. More importantly
there still seems to be a positive relationship between past cumulative
returns and future returns. However, to identify whether this
relationship is stronger or weaker at longer look back periods we will
have to complete a correlation and regression analysis.

Like that of the 3 year look back period the correlation between past
performance and funds flow is still weakly positive at 0.08. This is
stronger than that of the three year look back period at 0.07 however it
is not aas strong as I would have thought. Furthermore, the p-value has
increased from 0.04 (for the 3 year look back period) to 0.08 which
suggests that the results are not statistically significant at the 5\%
level. However, these results are still statistically significant at the
10\% level. The main takeaway from this correlation analysis is that by
increasing the look back period we have not increased the correlation
between past fund performance and funds flow.

Lets now have a look at the regression analysis for the 10 year look
back period.

\end{longtable}

From the above regression analysis the results provide some intresting
analysis. Like that of the correlation analysis, the regression analysis
states that there is a weak insignificant realtionship between past
cumulative returns and future returns. Thus, even if a fund performs
well for 10 years, this is not a solid indicator that the fund will
perform well in the follwoing period. Furthermore, the regression
analysis provides an extremily low r-squared value that suggests that
past performance does not hold a significant explantion in the future
returns of funds.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsubsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

For both the three year and ten year look back periods, past performance
is not a good indicator at both fund flows and future performance. this
suggests that when investors are looking to invest their money they look
at other factors rather than just past performance, which according to
our analysis is the right approach, as past performance is noot a good
indicator at futrure performance.
